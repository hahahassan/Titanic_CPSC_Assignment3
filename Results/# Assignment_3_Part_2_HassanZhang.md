## 1. Determine if the survival rate is associated with the class of passenger

1)  Block bar chart of 'survival by class'. Survival patterns in each class are different.![](images/survival_by_class.png)
2)  Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no association between the class of passengers and the survival rate. In other words, the class of passengers and survival rate are independent. Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is an association between the class of passengers and the survival rate. The two variables are dependent.
3)  significance level (α) = 0.05 (5%)
4)  p-value = 4.55e-23
5)  P-value \<\< 0.05, so I reject the null hypothesis. This suggests a significant association between passenger class and survival rate.
6)  Conclusion: the class of passengers and survival rate are associated.

## 2. Determine if the survival rate is associated to the gender

1)  Block bar chart of 'survival by gender'. Survival patterns in each gender are different.![](images/survival_by_sex.png)

2)  Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no association between the sex of passengers and the survival rate. In other words, the sex of passengers and survival rate are independent. Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is an association between the sex of passengers and the survival rate. The two variables are dependent.

3)  significance level (α) = 0.05 (5%)

4)  p-value = 1.197e-58

5)  P-value \<\< 0.05, so I reject the null hypothesis. This suggests a significant association between passenger sex and survival rate.

6)  Conclusion: the sex of passengers and survival rate are associated.

## 3. Determine the survival rate is associated to the age

1)  Block bar chart of 'survival by age group. Survival patterns in each gender are different.![](images/survival_by_age.png)

2)  Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no association between the age of passengers and the survival rate. In other words, the age of passengers and survival rate are independent. Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is an association between the age of passengers and the survival rate. The two variables are dependent.

3)  significance level (α) = 0.05 (5%)

4)  p-value = 0.0066

5)  P-value \<\< 0.05, so I reject the null hypothesis. This suggests a significant association between passenger age and survival rate.

6)  Conclusion: the age of passengers and survival rate are associated.
